12. Added the black version of Cristal See-Through Lower. (texture set and textures were included but forgot to add it as an armor in the ESP)

13. Bug found with the Olier hair. The path to the mesh was wrong. It is now corrected.

14. The ArmA WeaponAdjust values made weapons float too far from the body. The ESP update sets ArmA WeaponAdjust to 0.0 for everything to fit closer to the body.

15. Higher resolution textures for the metallic golden parts of the outfit stands. Texture was edited to be "darker" to make the gold stand out more.

16. Added higher resolution textures for the photo frames. They won't look blurry anymore.

17. Applies the CBBE Uniboob slider effect to 90% of the outfits. Most should start to look better now.

18. Updated all main outfit pieces to the most recent CBBE body.

19. Enabled weight slider for armor add-on objects that were missing it

20. Fixed Dawley Syande having outfit pieces with different classes. (They are all now light armor)

21. Fixed Blacksmith having outfit pieces with different classes. (They are all now heavy armor)

22. Fixed Dalgaebi having outfit pieces with different classes. (They are all now heavy armor)

23. Removed duplicate outfit pieces in the containers for 2019 Christmas and Bless MD 0102

24. Added 4 new weapons for fun. They are unrelated to Ninirim's content.

25. By popular request, added a smithing station at the museum. Most wanted to be able to craft the outfits at the museum

26. By popular request, the mod now comes with a custom made recipe book. This recipe book will unlock all ninirim outfit recipes when the book is in your inventory. This will help reduce clutter in your smithing station menu.

27. The museum can no longer be freely accessed. It now requires a custom made key to deter new files from getting overpowered weapons and armor at start.
